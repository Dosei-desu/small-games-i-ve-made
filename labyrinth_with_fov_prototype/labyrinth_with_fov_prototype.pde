//Labyrinth with field-of-view

//Updates:
/*
- Add pick-ups and portals.
*/

//Bugs:
/*
- Very rare bug where the enemies will be set to a speed of 0 
  or so close to 0 that they don't move. Have only encountered
  this once.
*/

//Notes:
/*
- Used https://print-graph-paper.com/virtual-graph-paper to draw maze.
  I broke down the graph paper so that each square was 50x50, meaning 16x16 squares
  of 50x50 = 800x800, i.e. the size() of my sketch
- Code for handling line/circle detection borrowed from:
  http://www.jeffreythompson.org/collision-detection/line-circle.php
*/

//Gameplay Notes:
/*
- Score is based on how fast you can make it to the end, i.e. the lower
  the better.
- There are roaming ghosts that will reset you if they touch you!
- On nightmare mode, ghosts are doubled, and their speed is also doubled,
  however, your timer only counts half as fast, making it possible to achieve
  even faster times than on normal mode.
- Theoretically, the lowest score possible is about 20-25s, my personal highscore 
  is 54s.
- You can see the eyes of the roaming ghosts and use it to your advantage!
